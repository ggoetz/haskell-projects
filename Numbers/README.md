Numbers
---------

**Closest pair problem** - Given _n_ points in a metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them. Ties can be broken up arbitrarily.

**Collatz conjecture** - Start with a number _n > 1_. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If _n_ is even, divide it by 2. If _n_ is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Decimal to binary and back** - Convert a binary number to decimal representation, or a decimal number to binary representation.

**Dijkstras algorithm** - Lets the user specify a graph (list of edges) and then finds the shortest path between two edges.

**Find Pi to the n-th digit** - Enter a number and have the program return pi up to that many decimal places.

**Prime Factorization** - Finds all the prime factors (if any) of a number entered by the user. 

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - Implement the sieve of eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers.

**Sorting** - Implement different sorting algorithms (e.g. merge sort, bubble sort).
