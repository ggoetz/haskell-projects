Numbers
---------

**Calculator** - A simple calculator to do basic operations. 

**Change return program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money give. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies for the change.

**Closest pair problem** - Given _n_ points in a metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them. Ties can be broken up arbitrarily.

[**Collatz conjecture**](./Collatz.hs) - Start with a number _n > 1_. Print the Collatz sequence: if _n_ is even, divide it by 2. If _n_ is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Terminate when _n == 1_.

**Credit card validator** - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor and validates it to make sure it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use checksums). 

**Decimal to binary and back** - Convert a binary number to decimal representation, or a decimal number to binary representation.

**Dijkstras algorithm** - Lets the user specify a graph (list of edges) and then finds the shortest path between two edges.

**Factorial finder** - Finds the factorial of a positive integer.

[**Fibonacci sequence**](./Fibonacci.hs) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that number, or up to the n-th number.

**Find Pi to the n-th digit** - Enter a number and have the program return pi up to that many decimal places.

**Prime Factorization** - Finds all the prime factors (if any) of a number entered by the user. 

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - Implement the sieve of eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers.

**Sorting** - Implement different sorting algorithms (e.g. merge sort, bubble sort).
