haskell-projects
================
This is a list of practical projects that can be solved in any programming language. This list is based on Martyr2's "Mega Project List" ([pdf](http://www.inf.ufg.br/~hugoribeiro/martyr2/martyr2.pdf)). 
A list of links to solutions to these projects in various languages can be found [here](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects-Solutions). 
Projects will be added to this repository as I start working on them.
